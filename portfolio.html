					</a>
					<p>Note: in-browser play requires Unity Web Player, which does not run in Chrome.</p>
					<p>I developed The Rite by myself in Unity 3D in less than 48 hours for the Global 
					GameJam 2016. The theme was "ritual". Assets were created with Maya 2015, GIMP, Paint 
					Tool SAI, and Garageband. A couple friends provided images to use in the game; 
					credits are on the GameJame site, linked below.

					<h3>Aster</h3>
					<img src = "images/aster.png">
					<p>I came up with the concept for Aster in March 2015, while studying abroad in 
					Singapore at Nanyang Technological University. I developed the idea there as a final 
					project for my History of Games class, and brought it back to University of Rochester,
					where it was chosen as a senior capstone project.</p>
					<p>I am the Project Manager, Creative Director, Artist, Level Designer, Game Writer, 
					Technical Writer, and Character Modeler on the team (and various other positions as 
					needed). The game is built in Unreal Engine. I designed levels and drew concept art 
					and visual assets in Paint Tool SAI and GIMP; I modeled characters in Sculptris and 
					Maya 2015. Some art can be found 
					<a href="http://astergame.tumblr.com/tagged/art">here</a>. I wrote the project plan
					and game script and have presented the game formally to panel members half a dozen
					times. As the team leader I have also kept my team organized and on track. Aster is
					due to be released in April 2016.

					<p>While studying in Singapore, I and two others collaborated on this video made with
					Maya 2015. I modeled a portion of the objects in the room, assisted in assembling the
					room, and applied the motion capture data and sound to the animation.</p>
