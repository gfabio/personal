				<h2>Games</h2>
				<p>While I am technically majoring in Digital Media at 
				<a href="http://www.rochester.edu/">University of Rochester</a>, I have done my utmost 
				to turn it into a Game Design curriculum. To this end, I spent a semester in Singapore at 
				<a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg">Nanyang Technological University</a> to study
				Interactive Media and game development. Listed here are the fruits of my efforts thus 
				far.

					<h3>The Rite</h3>

					</a>
					<p>Note: in-browser play requires Unity Web Player, which does not run in Chrome.</p>
					<p>I developed The Rite in Unity 3D in less than 48 hours for the Global GameJam 2016.
					The theme was "ritual", and I chose to play on the expectations of that word
					but ultimately pull away from that expectation. I had planned to go in with a team, 
					but plans fell apart and I ended up working by myself. Assets were created with Maya 
					2015, GIMP, Paint Tool SAI, and Garageband. A couple friends provided images to use 
					in the game; credits are on the GameJame site, linked below.

					<h3>Aster</h3>
					<a href="">
						<img src = "images/aster.png">
					</a>
					<p>I came up with the concept for Aster in March 2015, while spending my spring break 
					hiking in the mountains of Vietnam. I continued developing it on my own until it was
					chosen as a senior capstone project at University of Rochester. I am the Project 
					Manager, Creative Director, Artist, Level Designer, Game Writer, Technical Writer, 
					and Character Modeler on the team (and various other positions as needed).</p>
					<p>The game is built in Unreal Engine. I designed levels and drew concept art and
					visual assets in Paint Tool SAI and GIMP; I modeled characters in Sculptris and 
					Maya 2015. Some art can be found 
					<a href="http://astergame.tumblr.com/tagged/art">here</a>. I wrote the project plan
					and game script and have presented the game formally to panel members half a dozen
					times. As the team leader I have also kept my team organized and on track. Aster is
					due to be released in April 2016.

					<p>I made this very small "game" as a final project for a digital art class in 2014.
					To play, navigate with the arrow keys, and interact with any colored space by hitting
					the enter or return key. To continue, pick an option and follow that link.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, the embedded images in both options do not work on the
					OpenProcessing site, and the parts must be downloaded and opened in Processing
					to play. One is a maze while the other is a buzzer game-like path to follow.</p>
