					Technical Writer, and Character Modeler on the Aster team (and various other positions 
					as needed). The game is built in Unreal Engine. Some art can be found

					<p>Aster is a stealth game about rescuing refugees from war-torn cities.
					I developed the idea for the game while studying abroad in Singapore. Initially,
					it was to be a puzzle game in which the player drew arrows during the day, marking 
					an escape route; at night, the avatar would automatically follow the route. If the
					route didn't lead out of the city the player could attempt the puzzle again.</p>
					<p>Though the project was initially conceived on my own time, I developed it 
					further as a final project for one of my classes in Singapore (History of Games)
					and as a proposal for my Senior Capstone project. At the beginning of my senior
					year, Fall 2015, I pitched it again to my fellow seniors. I was able to convince 
					three others to join me in making my idea a reality.</p>

					<p>The game, now a collaborative effort, went through significant changes from
					my initial concept. We switched from 2D to 3D early on, as our developer was
					only familiar with Unreal Engine and its 3D capabilities. In the interest of
					splitting the work more evenly, I didn't get to work in-engine at all for the
					project; instead, I wrote the design document, designed the characters, and
					wrote the script. I also designed the layout of each city, and modeled several
					characters in 3D using Sculptris and Maya, though we ended up not using them.</p>
					<img class="devpics1" src="img/intromap.png">
					<p>As the one who came up with the idea, I was technically the team lead.
					However, as it was a collaborative project and we all had our own goals for
					the game, I did not actually have the authority to veto ideas or tell my
					teammates what to do. With only a minimal semblance of structure, the team 
					ended up disorganized, and the game suffered, particularly in scope. Of the 
					initial seven cities planned (each was a level, but could be returned to for
					additional puzzles), we built only four. Additionally, many mechanics, such 
					as placing arrows, which was the mechanic the game was based from, never
					made it into the game at all.</p>
					<p>Overall, Aster was a good learning experience. While the product was not
					what I had hoped for, the process of making it still taught us valuable
					lessons about the principles of game design, particularly the importance of 
					mechanics <em>and</em> story in the creation of an engaging experience, and 
					of course minding scope and feature creep. Had I more time, and more authority,
					I would have made sure the game had a strong mechanical foundation, and
					made sure the script was more rigorously implemented (or included at all).<p>
					<p>As it is, I hope to return to the idea sometime soon and build something
					closer to my own conception of the concept, using what I have learned to 
					both improve on my ideas and implement them the way I want to.</p>
